I'm sure we've all come across the terms "CPU" and "processor", especially when looking to buy a computer, and increasingly while buying smartphones as well. However, these inconspicuous feats of engineering  are far more versatile than most people know. For instance, how many of the following devices do you think requires a CPU ?
**Add pictures here**
- Washing Machine
- Car
- Induction Cooker
- Fire alarm
- Microwave Oven
- Refrigerator

If your answer is - **all of the above**, then congratulations ! While they certainly do not need a CPU for their basic functioning, all of the advanced features which enhance their functionality, reliability, and safety are only possible because of a trusty CPU under the hood.

This post gives a high level overview on the working of a generic CPU.
